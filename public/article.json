		"Secular education is important. But “education . . . that produces initials at the end of your name . . . is no guarantee of moral intelligence,” said an editorial in Canada’s newspaper Ottawa Citizen. Indeed, many highly educated people—including leaders in business and government—cheat, defraud, and steal, resulting in “a serious crisis of confidence,” according to a global study published by Edelman, a public relations firm.",
		"The Bible focuses on moral and spiritual education. It gives us insight into “what is righteous and just and fair, the entire course of what is good.” (Proverbs 2:9) To illustrate, a 23-year-old man, whom we will call Stephen, was in prison in Poland. While confined, he began to study the Bible and to appreciate its practical advice. “I now see what it means to ‘honor your father and your mother,’” he wrote. “I have also learned to control my emotions, especially excessive anger.”—Ephesians 4:31; 6:2."
